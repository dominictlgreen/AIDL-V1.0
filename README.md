# AIDL-V1.0
AIDL (Artificial Intelligence Data Language) Version 1.0 introduces a transformative, language-agnostic approach to AI data processing, training, and inference. Designed to optimize computational efficiency and future-proof system evolution, this abstraction layer delivers up to 2-25x reductions in compute cost and energy usage across processing layers. The core system is scalable across multiple platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and RISC-V.
