## AIDL (Artificial Intelligence Data Language) V1.0 2025
Version 1.0 introduces a transformative, language-agnostic approach to AI data processing, training, and inference. Designed to optimize computational efficiency and future-proof system evolution, this abstraction layer delivers up to 2-25x reductions in compute cost and energy usage across processing layers. The core system is scalable across multiple platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and RISC-V.

Compatible with C++, Rust, Python, NodeJS, CUDA & Risk-V RVV

Works with and/or alongside SQL, NoSQL & Vector Database(s)


Supports ingestion, sorting, training, pruning, refinement, inference and output

This paradigm of processing leverages o to the power of n reduction in compute horizontally and vertically.

(that scales across layers for vast compute and energy savings).

## 1.	Horizontal Reduction:

•	AIDL optimizes across distributed systems, reducing unnecessary inter-node communications and redundant operations when working with large datasets across multiple processors (CPUs/GPUs).

•	For example, parallel inference tasks can be coordinated in such a way that reduces re-computation or redundant paths, improving compute efficiency on cloud-scale systems.

 ## 2.	Vertical Reduction:

 •	Inside each stage of processing (ingestion, training, refinement, output), AIDL optimizes internal operations (e.g., sorting, lookup, pruning) to reduce O(n)-class operations into lower-complexity ones wherever possible.

 •	This could include things like pruning suboptimal paths in training early, minimizing dataset passes, or clustering similar operations.

Initial basic mathematical proof available via request.

This is its own abstraction (forget deepseek or qwen entirely / this predates them)

AIDL represents a novel layer of abstraction developed independently, built on fundamental design concepts that precede and surpass conventional paradigms. Unlike frameworks tied to specific architectures or pre-defined processing workflows, AIDL focuses on system-agnostic adaptability and scalable, real-time optimization. Its modular design ensures seamless integration across environments, regardless of chip type, software language, or data format.

By decoupling core computational processes from traditional constraints, AIDL enables dynamic, multi-directional scaling—handling ingestion, sorting, training, refinement, inference, and output efficiently while preserving future-proof extensibility. Its foundational approach differs conceptually from recent architectures designed for current-gen applications, as AIDL’s abstraction allows for evolution beyond present limitations.

In short, AIDL is not a derivative, but an original framework designed to address the emerging complexities of compute systems at their core.
