### VFLOW
- **Purpose:** Manages the flow of data through various processing stages, handling iteration, looping, forward passes, recursive operations, and backward passes.
- **Process:**
  - Orchestrates data movement in a controlled fashion.
  - Adjusts flow based on computational needs and data characteristics.

### VROUTE
- **Purpose:** Routes data flow as directed by VFLOW, ensuring optimal paths through the system.
- **Process:**
  - Analyzes data context and system load.
  - Chooses the most efficient path for data to travel through subsequent processing steps.

### GRIND
- **Purpose:** Processes and refines data, akin to "chewing" on it to extract or transform information.
- **Process:**
  - Applies complex transformations or analyses.
  - Adjusts data format or structure for further processing.

### INGEST
- **Purpose:** Imports and applies conversion mappings to incoming data.
- **Process:**
  - Receives data in multiple formats.
  - Standardizes data into an internal format using conversion maps.

### DIGEST
- **Purpose:** Not only processes data but also passes it along as it's further refined through the system.
- **Process:**
  - Continues transformation or analysis started by INGEST.
  - Prepares data for the next stages of processing or output.

### EXCRETE
- **Purpose:** Outputs processed data or results from the system.
- **Process:**
  - Formats data for external use or storage.
  - Ensures data integrity and relevance upon exit from the system.
