## Phase 3: Initial Integration via Chroma (lightweight pre testing)

- **Run ingested AIDL data against Chroma for initial lightweight benchmarking** 

Verify that ingested AIDL data is structured correctly for Chroma’s input requirements.  
Run initial data mapping and retrieval operations to evaluate query response times.  
Compare Chroma’s lightweight benchmarking results against ingestion times recorded in Phase 2.  
Identify potential bottlenecks or inconsistencies in Chroma’s handling of vectorized data.  
Log key performance metrics, including data retrieval speed and mapping accuracy.  
Summarize findings to inform adjustments before moving to Phase 4.  

Chroma acts as a high-performance vector store, indexing and retrieving vectorized representations of AIDL data for rapid querying and similarity searches. It ensures that early vectorization results can be cross-validated against its internal word lists and embeddings for consistency and optimization. By comparing retrieval efficiency and accuracy, this stage highlights how well the system’s vectorized data aligns with known semantic structures, paving the way for downstream model interactions.

Using Chroma is not necessary for training larger, more complex models; its role here is to provide a benchmarking layer for evaluating the efficiency of vectorized data handling. This stage ensures that data ingestion, storage, and retrieval are optimized, reducing potential bottlenecks and minimizing redundant computation before integrating larger models. By identifying inefficiencies early, it helps refine the data pipeline, ensuring that subsequent phases, including model training or inference, can operate with reduced overhead.

## Phase 4: Integration via Distilled Model(s)

- **Run ingested AIDL data against a distilled version of LLAMA for initial intermediate benchmarking**  
- **Run ingested AIDL data against a distilled version of Nemetron for initial intermediate benchmarking**  

Phase 4 focuses on testing AIDL’s ability to interact efficiently with distilled versions of major models. These distilled models, which represent simplified or smaller versions of the larger models, provide a good balance between computational efficiency and performance. The purpose of this phase is to validate that the ingested and mapped data can be used effectively without significant modifications or computational overhead. Key benchmarks will include latency, throughput, and model inference accuracy when processing AIDL data.

By using distilled models, this phase ensures that potential issues with data compatibility or conversion errors are identified and resolved before scaling up to full-sized models. Successful completion of this phase will confirm that AIDL is robust enough to handle complex workflows.

## Phase 5: Full-Scale Testing via Larger Models

- **Test system performance and scalability against larger models**  

Phase 5 involves testing the fully implemented AIDL system against large-scale models, such as full versions of LLAMA3 or Nemetron 340b. This stage is critical for understanding the scalability and efficiency of the system when dealing with real-world, high-dimensional data. The goal is to measure performance under large data loads, test retrieval times, and ensure that ingestion, mapping, and querying processes can maintain optimal speeds and accuracy at scale.

Additionally, resource utilization (CPU, GPU, memory) will be monitored to identify any bottlenecks. The benchmarks from this phase will be key in evaluating AIDL’s potential for deployment in production environments. If successful, this phase will demonstrate the system’s ability to handle large-scale deployments with minimal overhead.

## Ongoing Metrics & Data

- **Benchmarking of various functions and flows across stages** 

Throughout all phases, continuous monitoring of key metrics will be crucial to track system performance and guide optimizations. Metrics will include data ingestion times, query response rates, retrieval accuracy, and computational resource usage. For each phase, these metrics will be compared against predefined benchmarks to ensure progress and efficiency improvements.

Regular logging and visualization of metrics will allow for real-time insights into system behavior, making it easier to identify issues early and implement fixes. This ongoing feedback loop ensures that AIDL evolves with each iteration, improving both speed and accuracy.

## Final Outcome

- **Comprehensive data and proof of concept map** 

The final outcome of this roadmap will be a comprehensive proof-of-concept demonstrating AIDL’s efficiency and scalability across different scenarios. The completed map will showcase key performance metrics, highlighting the system’s ability to streamline vectorized data handling, improve retrieval processes, and integrate seamlessly with advanced models.

This documentation will serve as a foundation for future development, allowing for easy scaling, potential deployment, and further investment opportunities. By providing tangible evidence of performance gains, this proof-of-concept will reinforce AIDL’s value in reducing computational costs while maintaining high levels of accuracy and speed.
